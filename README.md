Data Visualization with Excel: My Experience
During my recent internship, I had the chance to work with data visualization using Excel. This project helped me practice cleaning, analyzing, and presenting data to create clear and informative visuals.
During the internship, I learned how to:
Prepare Data: Clean, format, and organize data to make sure it's accurate and consistent.
Choose Charts: Select the right chart types (like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts) to clearly show important trends and patterns.
Customize: Adjust charts with colors, labels, and formatting to make them easy to read and visually appealing.
Tell a Story: Use data visualization to build a narrative and present meaningful insights to stakeholders.
I'm excited to share my completed project, which shows my ability to turn raw data into clear and attractive presentations.
